# load-result-word-by-word-as-like-in-chatgpt-in-.net-maui-aiassistview
This demo shows how to load result word by word as like in ChatGpt in .NET MAUI AIAssistView.

## Sample

```xaml

        public GettingStartedViewModel()
        {
            azureAIService = new AzureAIService();
            this.messages = new ObservableCollection<IAssistItem>();
            this.AssistViewRequestCommand = new Command<object>(ExecuteRequestCommand);
        }

        public ICommand AssistViewRequestCommand { get; set; }


        public string? InputText
        {
            get { return inputText; }
            set { inputText = value; RaisePropertyChanged("InputText"); }
        }

        private async void ExecuteRequestCommand(object obj)
        {
            // Set Handled to true to prevent the addition of the user-requested item to the view. If the requested item is added to the ViewModel's AssistItems collection, the response indicator will also be included immediately. 
            // To restrict the response generator, we are adding the request item manually to collection.
            var eventArgs = obj as Syncfusion.Maui.AIAssistView.RequestEventArgs;
            eventArgs.Handled = true;

            // Retrieve the user-requested item using RequestEventArgs.RequestItem.
            var request = eventArgs.RequestItem;

            // Manually add the user-requested item to the AssistItems collection.
            this.AssistItems!.Add(request);

            // Clear the text of the editor in the SfAIAssistView.
            this.InputText = string.Empty;

            // Call the GetResult method to retrieve the ResponseItem corresponding to the requested item.
            await this.GetResult(request).ConfigureAwait(true);
        }

        private async Task GetResult(object inputQuery)
        {
            // Initially add a dummy response with an empty string.
            this.ResponseItem = new AssistItem() { Text = string.Empty };
            this.AssistItems!.Add(this.ResponseItem);

            AssistItem request = (AssistItem)inputQuery;
            if (request != null)
            {
                // Generate a response.
                var userAIPrompt = this.GetUserAIPrompt(request.Text);
                var response = await azureAIService!.GetResultsFromAI(request.Text, userAIPrompt).ConfigureAwait(true);
                response = response.Replace("\n", "<br>");

                // Split the response into words and store them in an array or collection.
                string[] words = response.Split(' ', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

                // Update the ResponseItem's Text property word by word with a delay to simulate continuous response generation.
                foreach (string word in words)
                {
                    await Task.Delay(50);
                    this.ResponseItem.Text += word + " ";

                }
                MessagingCenter.Send(this, "ScrollTo",string.Empty);
                this.ResponseItem.RequestItem = inputQuery;
            }
        }

```
